## Scoring Instructions

### Standard SUS Scoring (Questions 1-10)

### Step 1: Score Contribution Calculation
- For **odd-numbered questions (1, 3, 5, 7, 9)**: Subtract 1 from the user response
- For **even-numbered questions (2, 4, 6, 8, 10)**: Subtract the user response from 5

### Step 2: Calculate Total Score
Sum all the score contributions from Step 1.

### Step 3: Calculate Final SUS Score
Multiply the total from Step 2 by 2.5 to obtain the overall SUS score (range: 0-100).

---

### Extended Questions Scoring (Questions 11-25)

These additional questions provide deeper insights into specific Garmently features:

**Positive Questions (11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25):**
- Score = Response - 1
- Higher scores indicate better usability

**Negative Questions (12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24):**
- Score = 5 - Response
- Higher scores indicate better usability (reversed scoring)

**Calculate Extended Feature Score:**
1. Sum all contributions from questions 11-25
2. Divide by 15 to get average (0-4 scale)
3. Multiply by 25 to convert to 0-100 scale

**Combined Analysis:**
- Use SUS score (Q1-10) as the primary usability metric
- Use Extended score (Q11-25) to identify specific feature strengths/weaknesses

### Interpreting the SUS Score:
- **0-25**: Worst Imaginable
- **26-39**: Poor
- **40-52**: OK
- **53-73**: Good
- **74-85**: Excellent
- **86-100**: Best Imaginable

**Average SUS Score Benchmark:** 68

## Administration Guidelines

### When to Administer:
- After users complete key tasks (adding garments, creating outfits)
- At the end of a usability testing session
- After users have used the app for at least 10-15 minutes
- As part of periodic user satisfaction surveys

### Best Practices:
1. Administer immediately after interaction with the system
2. Don't explain the questions - let users interpret naturally
3. Don't provide hints or assistance during completion
4. Collect demographic data separately (before or after SUS)
5. Use exact wording of questions (don't modify)
6. Ensure users complete all 10 questions

### Sample Size Recommendations:
- **Minimum:** 8-12 users for reliable results
- **Recommended:** 20+ users for statistical significance
- **Ideal:** 30+ users for robust analysis

---

Display when user logs out or closes the app

### Option 3: Periodic Check-in
Prompt users after using the app for 7 days
